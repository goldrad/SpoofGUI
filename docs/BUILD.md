# Building SpoofGUI

This document describes the 1.0.2 release pipeline.

## What Gets Built

The release process produces four user-facing artifacts — one Setup installer and one Portable zip per architecture:

```text
dist\SpoofGUI-Setup-amd64.exe
dist\SpoofGUI-Setup-x86.exe
dist\SpoofGUI-Portable-amd64.zip
dist\SpoofGUI-Portable-x86.zip
```

> ARM64 is intentionally not shipped: the SNI spoof relies on the WinDivert kernel driver, which has no ARM64 build and cannot be loaded by an ARM64 Windows kernel. ARM64 users can run the amd64 build under x64 emulation for the userspace V2Ray modes, but the spoof feature will not work there.

### Portable layout (clean root)

The portable zip keeps its root clean — a single launcher plus the payload tucked away:

```text
SpoofGUI-Portable-amd64.zip
  SpoofGUI.exe        (tiny native launcher; this is what you run)
  app\                (everything else)
    SpoofGUI.exe      (the actual self-contained WinUI app)
    *.dll ...         (.NET runtime + Windows App SDK)
    Xray\xray.exe
    engine\SpoofGUI.SniSpoofEngine.exe, sing-box.exe, WinDivert*, wintun.dll
    source\SNI-Spoofing\
```

The root `SpoofGUI.exe` is a `requireAdministrator` launcher (`launcher\launcher.cpp`). It elevates once, then starts `app\SpoofGUI.exe`, so the real app sees an admin token without a second relaunch. The Setup installer uses the same layout under the install directory.

Each payload contains:

- The WinUI 3 frontend (self-contained, includes Windows App SDK + .NET runtime).
- The Python SNI-Spoof engine: `engine\SpoofGUI.SniSpoofEngine.exe` (PyInstaller --onefile bundle of the upstream tool).
- The WinDivert user DLL + driver (`.sys`) for the target architecture, copied from the matching-bitness `pydivert` install.
- `engine\sing-box.exe` ([SagerNet/sing-box](https://github.com/SagerNet/sing-box)) + `engine\wintun.dll` — used by Tunnel Mode.
- `Xray\xray.exe` ([XTLS/Xray-core](https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core)) — used by Proxy / System Proxy modes.
- A copy of the SNI-Spoofing Python source under `app\source\SNI-Spoofing\` (for licensing transparency).

`xray.exe`, `sing-box.exe`, and `wintun.dll` are not committed; the build fetches the architecture-correct binaries.

Target PCs should not need Python, .NET, or Windows App Runtime installed separately.

## Build Prerequisites

Required on the build machine only:

- .NET 10 SDK.
- **Python 3.11** matching each target architecture (CI pins 3.11). PyInstaller cannot cross-compile, so the x86 engine needs a 32-bit Python and the amd64 engine a 64-bit one. **Do not build the engine with another Python (e.g. 3.13)** — it can silently produce an engine that starts but passes no traffic. The script installs PyInstaller + `app\SpoofGUI\EngineSource\requirements.txt` automatically.
  - Easiest way to get a clean 3.11 toolchain with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/): `uv venv --seed --python 3.11 build\engine-venv-311`, then pass `-PythonExe build\engine-venv-311\Scripts\python.exe` to the engine build script.
- Visual Studio C++ build tools (for the native launcher — `cl.exe` / `rc.exe`, located via `vswhere`).
- Inno Setup 6 with `ISCC.exe` at the default install path.
- Internet access to fetch the cores and restore packages.

## One-Command Release

From the repository root:

```bat
build-release.bat
```

This thin wrapper calls `scripts\build-release.ps1`, which by default builds both `x86` and `amd64`. To build a single architecture (and pick a matching Python):

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\build-release.ps1 -Arch amd64
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\build-release.ps1 -Arch x86 -PythonExeX86 "C:\Python311-32\python.exe"
```

Per architecture, the orchestrator:

1. Aborts if `SpoofGUI.exe` is running.
2. Builds the **Python SNI-Spoof engine** via PyInstaller (matching-bitness Python) → `app\SpoofGUI\Engine\SpoofGUI.SniSpoofEngine.exe`, and copies the matching WinDivert files next to it.
3. Fetches the architecture-correct `xray.exe`, `sing-box.exe`, and `wintun.dll`.
4. Publishes the WinUI app self-contained for the target RID (`win-x64` / `win-x86`) to `dist\publish-<arch>`.
5. Copies the SNI-Spoofing Python source into the payload for transparency.
6. Compiles the native launcher for the target architecture and assembles the clean root layout under `dist\stage\<arch>`.
7. Zips the staged layout into `dist\SpoofGUI-Portable-<arch>.zip` and packs it into `dist\SpoofGUI-Setup-<arch>.exe` with Inno Setup.

> Building both architectures in one run overwrites the binaries under `app\SpoofGUI\Engine` and `app\SpoofGUI\Xray` with each architecture in turn; the default order ends on `amd64` so the working tree matches the committed binaries.

## Manual Backend Builds

### Python engine

```powershell
uv venv --seed --python 3.11 build\engine-venv-311
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\build-python-engine.ps1 -Arch amd64 -PythonExe "build\engine-venv-311\Scripts\python.exe"
```

Output: `app\SpoofGUI\Engine\SpoofGUI.SniSpoofEngine.exe`. Omit `-PythonExe` only if the `python` on PATH is already a 3.11 of the matching architecture; the script verifies the bit-width but not the version.

## Manual Frontend Publish

```powershell
dotnet publish app\SpoofGUI\SpoofGUI.csproj `
  -c Release `
  -p:Platform=x64 `
  -r win-x64 `
  --self-contained true `
  -p:PublishSingleFile=false `
  -p:PublishTrimmed=false `
  -o dist\publish-amd64
```

`PublishSingleFile=false` is intentional. WinUI 3 unpackaged apps need XAML, PRI, native runtime, and Windows App SDK files laid out beside the executable.

## Inno Setup Packages

The installer script lives in `../installer/`.

| Script | Output | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SpoofGUI.iss` | `SpoofGUI-Setup-<arch>.exe` | Installs the clean root layout to Program Files, creates shortcuts to the launcher, dark-mode installer, requests admin. Architecture and output name come from `SPOOFGUI_ARCH` / `SPOOFGUI_STAGE_DIR`. |

The portable build is a plain `.zip` (no installer) produced by `Compress-Archive`.

## CI

`.github/workflows/release.yml` runs a matrix over `amd64` (x64 Python) and `x86` (x86 Python) on `windows-latest`, builds each architecture with `build-release.bat -Arch <arch>`, and a final job collects all four artifacts into a draft GitHub Release.

## Runtime Notes

- The launcher elevates first; `Program.cs` still relaunches the inner app elevated if it is ever started directly without admin. Without elevation, WinDivert cannot open its kernel driver.
- The first launch creates `%LOCALAPPDATA%\SpoofGUI\spoofgui.db` (SQLite — profiles, V2Ray configs, settings).
- The default SNI listener is `127.0.0.1:40443`.
- Default proxy inbounds when V2Ray is connected: SOCKS `127.0.0.1:20882`, HTTP `127.0.0.1:20883` (both configurable on the Settings page).
- "System Proxy" mode rewrites `HKCU\...\Internet Settings\ProxyServer` and calls `InternetSetOption(INTERNET_OPTION_PER_CONNECTION_OPTION)` so WinINet apps pick up the change immediately. It is reverted on disconnect.
- The update channel points to [ZethRise/SpoofGUI](https://github.com/ZethRise/SpoofGUI).

## Backend Summary

The shipping app spawns the SNI engine plus one proxy core depending on the active mode:

| Process | Source | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SpoofGUI.SniSpoofEngine.exe` | `app/SpoofGUI/EngineSource/` (vendored Python) | Reads `engine\config.json`, runs the WinDivert + fake-ClientHello listener on port 40443. A single dropped connection no longer terminates the engine (1.0.2 fix). |
| `xray.exe` | fetched ([XTLS/Xray-core](https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core)) | Proxy / System Proxy modes. Started by `XrayCoreService` after generating `%LOCALAPPDATA%\SpoofGUI\xray-client.json` (SOCKS/HTTP inbounds). |
| `sing-box.exe` | fetched ([SagerNet/sing-box](https://github.com/SagerNet/sing-box)) | Tunnel Mode only. Started by `SingBoxTunnelService` as a full core: tun inbound (`auto_route` + `strict_route`) + the profile's proxy outbound. `auto_detect_interface` keeps the server dial off the tunnel. |
